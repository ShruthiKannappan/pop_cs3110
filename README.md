## Projects

### Lambda Calculus Interpreter

Implements untyped lambda calculus interpreters with multiple reduction strategies, exploring substitution, variable binding, and evaluation order.

### Prolog Interpreter

Implements a subset of Prolog in OCaml with backtracking and choice points. Demonstrates logical programming within a functional language using constructs such as `List.map` and `List.fold_left`.
